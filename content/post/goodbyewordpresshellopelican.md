After one year of dedicated blogging, I have decided to ditch WordPress in favor of Pelican for my current blogging needs. This change has many benefits that are more in line with my current mindset for this project along with being easier to push content out.

WordPress in general is great for an easy to use CMS. However as someone who enjoys python, Pelican was an easy transition. Additionally, due to Pelican being a static site, the server load required to run this blog is significantly lower, allowing it to be hosted on Github.

Which is also a benefit due to not having a server to maintain. Lastly, the popularity and ease of use with WordPress has made it a huge target for compromise. Bots were hitting my page left and right attempting to compromise my site through vulnerable plug-ins on a daily basis, so finally I decided to “pull chocks” while taking a simpler approach.

This format allows me to focus on pushing valuable content out (hopefully), while not being concerned with server logs and XSS bugs in plugins. Stay tuned for future updates.

As always, be awesome, be humble and get after it
