#### Now page inspired by <a href="http://sivers.org/now">Derek Sivers</a>

#### In no particular order I am currently working on the following:

Dabbling in Reverse Engineering and blogging more about it on here. 

Spending time with my mini-me's. My girls are getting older and I love teaching them new things. I spend quite a bit of my "free time" fostering their curiosity for the world. 

Reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2LuL9ec">Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds </a> by David Goggins. The baddest man on the planet.

Exploring ways to be more creative: writing, drawing, and writing a self-published book....kinda (no clue on release and doing it in my spare-spare time)

Enjoying life
